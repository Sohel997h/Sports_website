            <h4 class="heading">Kabaddi</h4>
            <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players, originating from India. The
                objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the
                opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players and return to their own half of
                the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player
                tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.</p>

            <h4 class="heading">Basketball</h4>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another
                on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
                inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted
                10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from
                shooting through their own hoop.</p>

            <h4 class="heading">Cricket</h4>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of
                which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
                three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the
                bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by
                preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each
                batter (so they are "out").
